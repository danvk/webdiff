## Installation

    pip install webdiff

or, if you prefer [Homebrew]:

    brew install danvk/webdiff/webdiff

(the latter will also install [ImageMagick] as a recommended dependency.)

## Usage

Instead of running "git diff", run:

    git webdiff

You can also start webdiff via:

    git webdiff [args]

You can pass all the same arguments that you would to `git diff`, e.g.
`1234..5678` or `HEAD`.

`webdiff` can also be invoked directly to diff two directories or files:

    webdiff <left_dir> <right_dir>
    webdiff <left_file> <right_file>

You can also use `webdiff` to view GitHub pull requests:

    webdiff https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
    webdiff '#150'  # if you're in a git repo with a github remote

This will download the files relevant to the Pull Request and run `webdiff`.

If you run into GitHub API quota limits or you'd like to use webdiff with
private repos, you can set your credentials in a `.githubrc` file:

    user.login: yourusername
    user.token: your-personal-access-tokens

Make sure you chmod this file to only be readable by yourself. You can generate
a personal access token for webdiff via github.com → profile → Settings →
Personal access tokens. Make sure to grant all the "repo" privileges.

You can also use `git webshow` in place of `git show` to show a single commit:

    git webshow HEAD

`git webshow REF` is shorthand for `git webdiff REF^..REF`.

## Configuration

webdiff can be configured via [`git config`][git config]. To change the syntax highlighting theme, for example:

    git config webdiff.theme rainbow

(You can find a list of supported themes in the [themes] directory.)

As with any git configuration setting, these can be set globally or per-repo.

Options are:

| Setting        | Default       | Notes  |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| webdiff.theme  | googlecode    | Syntax highlighting theme (see [themes] directory). |
| webdiff.port   | -1            | Port on which to serve webdiff. Default is random open port. This can be overridden with the `--port` command line flag or the `WEBDIFF_PORT` environment variable. |
| webdiff.host   | localhost     | Host name on which to serve the webdiff UI. Use `0.0.0.0` to serve publicly. The special value `<hostname>` uses your computer's network name. This can be overridden with the `--host` command line flag or the `WEBDIFF_HOST` environment variable. |
| webdiff.maxDiffWidth | 100 | Maximum length of lines in the diff display. After this width, lines will wrap. |
| webdiff.unified | 8 | Lines of context to display by default (`git diff -U`) |
| webdiff.extraDirDiffArgs | "" | Any extra arguments to pass to `git diff` when diffing directories. |
| webdiff.extraFileDiffArgs | "" | Any extra arguments to pass to `git diff` when diffing files. |
| webdiff.openBrowser | true | Whether to automatically open the browser UI when you run webdiff. |
| webdiff.maxLinesForSyntax | 10000 | Maximum lines in file to do syntax highlighting. |
| webdiff.colors.delete | #fee | CSS background color for delete (left) lines |
| webdiff.colors.insert | #efe | CSS background color for insert (right) lines |
| webdiff.colors.charDelete | #fcc | CSS background color for deleted characters in a delete (left) line |
| webdiff.colors.charInsert | #cfc | CSS background color for inserted characters in an insert (right) line |

## Development

    poetry install
    cd ts
    yarn
    # see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532
    NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider webpack

Then from the root directory:

    poetry run webdiff/app.py testdata/dygraphsjs/{left,right}

or to launch in debug mode:

    ./test.sh $(pwd)/testdata/manyfiles/{left,right}

(or any other directory in testdata)

To run the Python tests:

    poetry run pytest

To format the code, run:

    poetry run ruff format
    cd ts
    yarn prettier

To debug `git webdiff`, run:

    ./test-gitwebdiff.sh

## Publishing

To iterate on the PyPI package, run:

    pip3 uninstall webdiff
    poetry build
    pip3 install dist/webdiff-?.?.?.tar.gz

To publish to pypitest:

    poetry build
    poetry publish -r testpypi

And to the real pypi:

    poetry publish

See [pypirc][] and [poetry][] docs for details on setting up tokens for pypi.

Publication checklist. Do these from _outside_ the webdiff directory:

- Run `webdiff webdiff/testdata/.../{left,right}`
- Run `git webdiff 52aa15f^..52aa15f` in the codediff.js repo
- Run `git webshow 52aa15f` from the codediff.js repo (should be same as previous command)
- Run `webdiff https://github.com/danvk/webdiff/pull/160`

## Implementation notes

webdiff doesn't calculate any diffs itself. Instead, it relies on `git diff`. This is possible because `git diff` has a `--no-index` mode that allows it to operate outside of a git repository. Of course, this means that you need to have `git` installed to use webdiff!

When you run `webdiff dir1 dir2`, webdiff runs:

    git diff --raw --no-index dir1 dir2

To ask `git` which files are adds, removes, renames and changes. Then, when it's serving the web UI for a particular diff, it runs:

    git diff --no-index (diff args) file1 file2

This produces a patch, which is what the web UI renders. (It also needs both full files for syntax highlighting.)

When you run `git webdiff (args)`, it runs:

    git difftool -d -x webdiff (args)

This tells `git` to set up two directories and invoke `webdiff leftdir rightdir`.

There's one complication involving symlinks. `git difftool -d` may fill one of the sides (typically the right) with symlinks. This is faster than copying files, but unfortunately `git diff --no-index` does not resolve these symlinks. To make this work, if a directory contains symlinks, webdiff makes a copy of it before diffing. For file diffs, it resolves the symlink before passing it to `git diff --no-index`. The upshot is that you can run `git webdiff`, edit a file, reload the browser window and see the changes.
