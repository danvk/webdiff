## Installation

    pip install webdiff

## Usage

Instead of running "git diff", run:

    git webdiff

You can also start webdiff via:

    git webdiff [args]

You can pass all the same arguments that you would to `git diff`, e.g.
`1234..5678` or `HEAD`.

`webdiff` can also be invoked directly to diff two directories or files:

    webdiff <left_dir> <right_dir>
    webdiff <left_file> <right_file>

You can also use `webdiff` to view GitHub pull requests:

    webdiff https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
    webdiff #123  # if you're in a git repo with a github remote

This will download the files relevant to the Pull Request and run `webdiff`.

If you run into GitHub API quota limits or you'd like to use webdiff with
private repos, you can set your credentials in a `.githubrc` file:

    user.login: yourusername
    user.token: your-personal-access-tokens

Make sure you chmod this file to only be readable by yourself. You can generate
a personal access token for webdiff via github.com → profile → Settings →
Personal access tokens. Make sure to grant all the "repo" privileges.

## Development

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ts
    yarn
    # see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532
    NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider webpack

Then from the root directory:

    PYTHONPATH=. ./webdiff/app.py testdata/dygraphsjs/{left,right}

or to launch in debug mode:

    ./test.sh $(pwd)/../testdata/webdiffdiff/{left,right}

(or any other directory in testdata)

To run the Python tests:

    pytest

To run the JavaScript tests:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    open tests/runner.html

To format the code, run:

    ./scripts/black.sh
    cd ts
    yarn prettier

To iterate on the PyPI package, run:

    # from outside the webdiff virtualenv:
    pip uninstall webdiff

    # from inside the webdiff virtualenv, adjust for current version
    python setup.py sdist
    mkdir /tmp/webdiff-test
    cp dist/webdiff-X.Y.Z.tar.gz /tmp/webdiff-test

    deactivate
    cd /tmp/webdiff-test
    pip3 install webdiff-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

To publish to pypitest:

    pip install --upgrade wheel setuptools twine
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload -r testpypi dist/*

And to the real pypi:

    twine upload dist/*
